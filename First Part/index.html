    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Ariel ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      After high school, I want to study <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong>.  
      I like the idea of combining biology, engineering, and computing devices 
      to solve real-world problems. Just like a <em>computer network</em> 
      connects devices, I want to build systems that connect technology 
      with the human body.

    <h2>Unit 1: Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data is at the heart of everything. A single <strong>bit</strong> is just 0 or 1, 
      but together, 8 bits make a <strong>byte</strong>, which stores more complex information.  
      I learned about how <strong>analog data</strong> (like a live concertâ€™s sound) can be 
      converted into digital form. When computers compress data, they use 
      <strong>lossless</strong> methods (keeping all the details) or <strong>lossy</strong> methods 
      (throwing away some information, like a blurry photo).  
      Even <strong>metadata</strong> (data about data, like an imageâ€™s resolution) plays a role 
      in how we organize and use information.

    <h2>Unit 2: Computer Systems & Networks</h2>
    <p>
      The internet works because of many <strong>computing devices</strong> 
      connected in a <strong>computer network</strong>. Messages travel across different 
      <strong>paths</strong>, split into <strong>packets</strong>, and follow rules called 
      <strong>protocols</strong> like <em>TCP</em> or <em>UDP</em>.  
      Routers help those packets find the fastest way, using systems like the 
      <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> to translate names into IP addresses.  
      Thanks to <strong>fault tolerance</strong> and <strong>redundancy</strong>, the network keeps 
      running even when parts fail â€” which shows amazing <strong>scalability</strong> as billions 
      of devices connect.  
      It all comes together with <strong>HTTP</strong>, the protocol that delivers the 
      <em>World Wide Web</em>.
